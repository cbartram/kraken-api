# Simulation Engine

The `sim` package of the API includes classes for simulating game ticks, NPC pathing, movement, line of sight, and players. This is useful for advanced
plugins which evaluate hundreds of potential outcomes every game tick to determine the best "decision". e.g. Inferno and Colosseum plugins
