# üöÄ Getting Started (For Developers)

Kraken API is designed to extend the RuneLite API with additional client-interaction utilities for writing automation based plugins that are compatible with RuneLite. If you are
just looking to use pre-existing plugins, you can skip this repository and head over to our website: [kraken-plugins.duckdns.org](https://kraken-plugins.duckdns.org).

### Prerequisites
- [Java 11+](https://adoptium.net/) (JDK required)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (wrapper included, no need to install globally)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [RuneLite](https://runelite.net) (for testing and running plugins)


### Cloning the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cbartram/kraken-api.git
cd kraken-api
````

### Building

You can build the project with Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

The output API `.jar` will be located in:

```
./lib/build/libs/kraken-api-<version>.jar
```

### Running Tests

Run the full test suite with:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Using Kraken API in Your Plugin

Add the dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "https://maven.pkg.github.com/cbartram/kraken-api" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation group: 'com.github.cbartram', name:'kraken-api', version: '1.0.12'
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You may need a GitHub token with `read:packages` permission to authenticate with the package registry.

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `master`
2. Implement or update your plugin/feature for the API
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Run `./gradlew build` to verify that the API builds and tests pass
5. Commit your changes with a clear message `git commit -m "feat(api): Add feature X to Kraken API"`
6. Open a Pull Request

## Deployment

The Kraken API is automatically built and deployed via GitHub actions on every push to the `master` branch.
The latest version can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/cbartram/kraken-api/releases) section of the repository.

A deployment consists of:

- Building the API JAR
- Publishing a new version to the GitHub Releases section
  - This will be picked up by jitpack.io for easy integration into other gradle projects.
- Uploading the JAR file to the Minio storage server used by the Kraken Client at runtime.
- (Optional) Updating the `bootstrap.json` in the Kraken Client to point to the latest version of the API JAR file
- (Optional) Updating the build.gradle file in the Kraken Client to use the latest version of the API JAR file
